## Description
This project allows users to generate a random combination of words taken from a 20 word array. Users can also specify whether to append a number and symbol at the end. The minimum number of words is four, maximum is nine. The server validates the user's input if the number entered is not within 4 and 9.

## Details for teaching team
When you validate the HTML, line 33 of the index.php page will have an empty heading warning. That's because the h3 tag doesn't have the error message to style if the user has entered a number between 4 and 9.
